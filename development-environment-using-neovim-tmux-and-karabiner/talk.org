** Index
*** Goals
- Arouse curiosity about the customization of the development
  environment.
- To share some tips and tools that can be helpful to improve or analyze
  the development environment.
- To understand that you can choose to integrate any tool you want. No
  need to follow everything. If you're comfortable with you environment,
  great!

*Note*: This talk is not a deep dive in the tools. It's an overview of
what is possible.

*** What should you look for in a good development environment?
- Avoid repeating tasks.
- Comfort.

- Fun... Because why not?

*** Tools
- [[./terminal.md][Terminal]]
- [[./neovim.md][Neovim]]
- [[./tmux.md][Tmux]]
- [[./karabiner.md][Karabiner]]

*** Managing multiple instances of the same app
By using *CMD + `* you can change between the instances of the same
application. Really useful for multiple browsers or editor instances.

*** Persisting the configuration

A development configuration needs a lot of time and effort, so it's good
to have it secure and portable. For this, it's recommended to save your
=dotfiles= somewhere. There's a lot of options, but personally I use git
with a bare repository. You can follow this tutorial to manage your
=dotfiles= https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles
