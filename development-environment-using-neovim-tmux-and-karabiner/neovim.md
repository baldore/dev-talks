# Neovim

## What is Neovim
It's the editor!

## Advantages of Neovim
- Incredibly extensible.
- Amazing documentation via `:h`.

## Disadvantages
- Learning curve.
- Configuration.

## Some features
- Movement.
- Window management.
- Mappings.
- Jumps.
- Excellent integration with the UNIX environment.

## Where to start?
- Run `vimtutor`
- Run `vim +h user-manual`

## I don't want to use this editor
- Use a plugin for your editor.
    - [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim)
    - [Intellij](https://github.com/JetBrains/ideavim)

**Note**: even if this is a good approach, you won't have access to all the possibilities the editor has.
Again, use what you find useful.
