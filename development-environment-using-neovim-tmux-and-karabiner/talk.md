### Managing multiple instances of the same app
By using **CMD + `** you can change between the instances of the same application. Really useful for multiple browsers or editor instances.

### Persisting the configuration
A development configuration needs a lot of time and effort, so it's good to have it secure and portable. For this, it's recommended to save your `dotfiles` somewhere.
There's a lot of options, but personally I use git with a bare repo. You can follow this tutorial to manage your `dotfiles` https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles
